# Material New Tab

A new-tab extension for Chromium browsers inspired by Material Design.

## Overview

Material New Tab is designed mainly to solve two issues:

1. The lack of color customization in browsers.
   - Most browsers are restricted to dark or light themes, and even if they offer additional colors, they are usually not customizable.
2. The lack of interoperability of the new tab between different browsers.
   - Each browser has its own new tab page, which is hardly customizable, making it hard to switch browsers.

## The Material New Tab Approach

Material New Tab is set to be an extension, making it installable on all Chromium browsers. It functions on the basis of an app grid; the new tab space is utilized efficiently. It is divided into a set of square cells, each cell representing a basic space unit similar to how mobile app grids work. These cells can be used to place apps/web shortcuts and widgets that vary in their sizes. This approach is highly customizable while maintaining order.

Here's a look at how Material New Tab will look:

Additionally, the extension will allow primary and secondary color picking to customize the new tab. It will also offer a Chrome theme generation to apply the theme browser-wide.

## Disclaimer

> **Changing the browser theme is prohibited for extensions for safety reasons by the browser itself.**
>
> The only way I could provide browser theming is by giving the user the theme so they can manually install it.
